                    Pablo Picasso is considered to be one of the most famous painters in the twentieth century.
                    He was born in Malaga, Spain on October 20, 1881. In addition to painting, Picasso was also a printmaker, 
                    ceramicist, stage designer, poet and playwright. He spent most of his adult life in France.
                    Picasso had affairs with a lot of women and was married twice and had four children, Paulo, Maya, 
                    Claude and Paloma by three women. He died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins, France,
                    while he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner. He was interred at the Chateau of
                    Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence, a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline
                    between 1959 and 1962. Jacqueline Roque prevented his children Claude and Paloma from attending the funeral. 
                    Devastated and lonely after the death of Picasso, Jacqueline Roque killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when
                    she was 59 years old.
